# MobileAutomation

Goal:
1. To create robust automation framework to enable detail test step log, test cases parameterise. test debuging and reporting.
2. To create a UI base test client, which enable easy drag and drop on test suite creation, enable manual tester to get involved into the execution process, to have an easier execution process monitoring, better controlling.(We can easily stop any of the current executing script without stopping the whole testing batch.)
